# Frontend Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for modern front-end prototypes and experiments. Webpack is used to transpile ES6 code to regular JavaScript, and postcss-cli is used to transform fancy CSS into regular CSS. CSSNext allows for future CSS syntax and autoprefixing, and CSS code may be nested a la SCSS style for ease of composition.

`npm start` will run watchers on JavaScript and CSS, bundle and serve them to `localhost:3000`

`npm run build` will minify all code and copy the files into `/dist`
